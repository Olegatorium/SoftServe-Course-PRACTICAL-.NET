Please, make refactoring of the code:

      We know that adult  doesn't have childIDNumber 

       child doesn't have passportNumber.

       Create a public constructor in each class to initialize all their fields (make the first parameter of type int and the second one for name initialization).

       Accessibility of the fields should be the least possible, but the same in all assemblies.

       Add ToString() method to Child and Adult classes that will return a string in the format: "name document_number"

     

    public class Person
    {
        protected string childIDNumber;
    }

 public class Child
    {
        private int yearOfBirth;
        private string healthInfo;
        private string name;
        public string GetHealthStatus() { return name + ": " + yearOfBirth + ". " + healthInfo;}
    }

 public class Adult
    {
        private int yearOfBirth;
        private string healthInfo;
        private string passportNumber;
        private string name;
        public string GetHealthStatus() {return name + ": " + yearOfBirth + ". " + healthInfo; }
    }
