Create class Fraction with private int fields numerator and denominator that can only be initialized on creation or in constructor

Create a constructor to initialize these values

Define operators unary and binary + and - (example: Fraction(-167, 100) - Fraction(3, 2) should result in "-317 / 100")

Define the ! operator that will return reversed fraction - with numerator as denominator and denominator as numerator (For example, Fraction(-3, 100) results to "-100 / 3")

Define binary  * and / operations.

All operations should return simplified fractions.

Define ToString() method which will return string representing Fraction in the format numerator / denominator. 

Value should be simplified: numerator and denominator divided by the greatest common divisor. 

if  numerator and denominator are both negative, the fraction should become positive. 

If only denominator is negative the sign should be outputted before numerator without space.

Define Equals method and operators == and !=. Fractions are equal if their simplified versions are equal. 

(for example, 20/25 is equal to 4/5)

Define GetHashCode() method with the implementation of your choice.
