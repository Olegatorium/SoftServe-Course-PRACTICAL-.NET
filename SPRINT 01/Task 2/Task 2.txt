Create a Point class which models a 2D point with x and y coordinates should contain:

Two instance variables x and y  of int type, that will be available only in this class.

A constructor that constructs a point with the given x and y coordinates.

A method GetXYPair() which returns the x and y in a 2-element int array. This method should be available everywhere in the current assembly

A method called Distance(int x, int y) that returns the distance (double) from this point to another point at the given (x, y) coordinates.

An overloaded Distance(Point point) method that returns the distance from this point to the given Point instance.

The distance methods should be available everywhere in the current assembly and in descendant classes in other assemblies;

Create explicit cast to double operator that returns the distance (double) from this point to the origin (0, 0).
