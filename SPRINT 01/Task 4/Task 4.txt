Suppose, you have class:

public abstract class CloseableResource
{
    public void Close() 
    {
      // some closing actions
    }

    //some code

}

Please, create class DisposePatternImplementer that implements Disposable pattern and inherits from CloseableResource class

Print such lines of information in the method responsible for releasing managed and unmanaged resources:

"Disposing by developer" if the object of the class is disposed by developer

or "Disposing by GC" if the object is disposed by garbage collector

also, you should ensure that method Close() is called in either case.
