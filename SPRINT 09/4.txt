Suppose we have a class named Calc which has a method Seq
generating n-th member of a certain number sequence (starting from 1).

Define a class named CalcAsync. In this class:

Write an asynchronous stream called SeqStreamAsync taking integer parameter n,
that returns a collection of n tuples
consisting of a number i (from 1 to n) and i-th member of the sequence.

Write an asynchronous static method PrintStream
taking an asynchronous stream of tuples consisting of 2 integer numbers,
which prints the collection as follows:
"Seq[X] = Y", where X is the first item of a tuple, Y is the second one.
