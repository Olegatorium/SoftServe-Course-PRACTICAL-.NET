Suppose we have a class named Calc which has a method Seq
generating n-th member of a certain number sequence (starting from 1).

Define a class named CalcAsync. In this class:

Write an asynchronous static method PrintSpecificSeqElementsAsync
taking an array of integers as a patameter,
which performs a calculation of apropriate sequence member
according to each number in the input array
and prints out the result as follows:
"Seq[X] = Y", where X is a number from input array, Y is the corresponding sequence member.
Each calculation should be performed in a separate task.
After last calculation is performed, the list of found exceptions should be printed.

(The method Seq generates appropriate exception for non-positive input parameter.)
